<p><strong>Abstract.</strong> <small>The study of hand-object interaction requires generating viable grasp poses for high-dimensional multi-finger models, often relying
on analytic grasp synthesis which tends to produce brittle and unnatural
results. This paper presents Graspâ€™D, an approach for grasp synthesis
with a differentiable contact simulation from both known models as
well as visual inputs. We use gradient-based methods as an alternative
to sampling-based grasp synthesis, which fails without simplifying assumptions, such as pre-specified contact locations and eigengrasps. Such
assumptions limit grasp discovery and, in particular, exclude high-contact
power grasps. In contrast, our simulation-based approach allows for stable,
efficient, physically realistic, high-contact grasp synthesis, even for gripper morphologies with high-degrees of freedom. We identify and address
challenges in making grasp simulation amenable to gradient-based optimization, such as non-smooth object surface geometry, contact sparsity,
and a rugged optimization landscape. Graspâ€™D compares favorably to
analytic grasp synthesis on human and robotic hand models, and resultant
grasps achieve over 4Ã— denser contact, leading to significantly higher
grasp stability.</small></p>
